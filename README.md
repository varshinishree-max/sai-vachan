# Sai Vachan

**Sai Vachan** is a minimalist Google Chrome extension designed to deliver a randomly generated quotation of **Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba** through a single user interaction.  
Developed during His **100th Centenary year**, the project explores how values-based content can be meaningfully integrated into everyday digital environments.

With a single click, devotees receive a thoughtfully presented quotation, allowing Swami’s message to gently accompany them through work, study, or quiet moments online.

Built with love and gratitude, Sai Vachan reflects an intention to keep technology aligned with the values of **faith, simplicity, and inner stillness**. The extension prioritizes simplicity, performance efficiency, and respectful visual presentation, ensuring minimal cognitive and technical overhead for the user.
